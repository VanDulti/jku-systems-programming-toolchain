# jku-systems-programming-toolchain

Docker Image be used to compile my systems-programming tasks from jku either

1. manually within the container or 
2. as a clion toolchain to develop seemlessly in clion, even on non-linux non-x86 hosts (e.g. arm machines such as apple silicon macs)

This removes the hustle of system & compiler dependent behaviour.
